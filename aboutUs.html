        <h3> About Us </h3>
        <h4> Every time you receive a greeting card, what happens to the envelope? If you’re like the majority of people, you probably throw it away immediately. <br> <br>What if we told you, there’s a better way? Our company came up with a card that grows! </h4>
        <p> Bloom & Seal is a local JABC student-led company that creates premium eco-friendly greeting cards made of 100% recycled paper. Each card includes a plantable envelope embedded with wildflower seeds and a handmade wax seal stamp. After enjoying the heartfelt message, the recipient can plant the envelope, and watch wildflowers bloom, which are helpful for pollinators like bees which are essential to our ecosystem</p>

        <h3> Production </h3>

        <p> Each of our wax seals is handcrafted by our team. The process involves carefully melting wax beads and sealing them with a custom stamp of our logo. We also design all our cards ourselves using Canva, adding our own creative touch to every product. In addition, the cards are printed at Staples using 100% recycled paper.</p>
        <h4 class="quote"> Our mission is to make the world more sustainable, one card at a time.</h4>
